Welcome to alquimia's documentation!
====================================

Description
-----------

Alquimia is an biogeochemistry API and wrapper library. The aim is to
provide a unified interface to the biogeochemistry routines from high
quality reactive transport simulators such as `PFLOTRAN
<https://bitbucket.org/pflotran/pflotran-dev>`_ or `CrunchFlow
<http://www.csteefel.com/CrunchFlowIntroduction.html>`_ , allowing any
subsurface flow and transport simulator to access a range of
functionality.

It is not an implementation of a biogeochemistry reaction library, and
does not do any geochemical calculations.

Availability
------------

The official repository for Alquimia API documentation and reference
API is `<https://bitbucket.org/berkeleylab/alquimia>`_.

The alquimia API is intended to be open and implemented by anyone. The
reference implementation developed by `Lawrence Berkeley National
Laboratory <http://www.lbl.gov>`_ is open source, licensed under a BSD
:ref:`license`.

Versioning
----------

Alquimia API and reference implementation use `Semantic Versioning
<http://semver.org/>`_.

Style Guide
-----------

The Alquimia API and library will use the `Google C++ style guide
<http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/cppguide.xml>`_
where appropriate. In particular, the naming conventions should be
followed consistently on both sides (driver and engine) of the
interface wrapper code. Engines are obviously allowed to use their own
internal coding styles in their own code.
