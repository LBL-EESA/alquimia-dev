   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to alquimia's documentation!
====================================

Alquimia will use `Semantic Versioning <http://semver.org/>`_ for its public API.

The Alquimia API and library will use the `Google C++ style guide
<http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/cppguide.xml>`_
where appropriate. In particular, the naming conventions should be
followed consistently on both sides (driver and engine) of the
interface wrapper code. Engines are obviously allowed to use their own
internal coding styles in their own code.
