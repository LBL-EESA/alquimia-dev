\begin{frame}{The Alquimia Philosophy}
\Large
\begin{itemize}
\item What Alquimia \bluecolor{is}:
\begin{itemize}
\Large
\item An API and wrapper facilitating interfacing with existing, external
      geochemistry codes as 3$^\text{rd}$ party libraries
%\item Geochemical democracy
\end{itemize}

\vspace{1cm}
\item What Alquimia \redcolor{is not}:
\begin{itemize}
\Large
\item A geochemistry library implementation
%\item Geochemical coercion
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Alquimia Concept}
Provide a uniform application programming interface (API) through which (solute) transport simulators may couple to third-party geochemical reaction libraries.  The API
\begin{itemize}
\item Provides a common set of primitive data structures to which data structures from 3$^\text{rd}$ party libraries may be mapped.
\item Provides common handles (routines) for
\begin{itemize}
\item Reading and initializing the geochemical basis and associated reactions.
\item Integrating a time step at a single grid cell.
\item Extracting geochemical concentrations.
\end{itemize}
\item Serves solely to pass information between transport and reaction components (i.e. it does not drive the geochemical solution procedure).
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}{Alquimia: Required Functionality}
\begin{itemize}
\item Handles for
\begin{itemize}
\item Reading of geochemical reaction data
\item Basis management (e.g. reading and setting the basis)
\item Constraint processing for geochemical conditions (e.g. boundary/initial conditions, source/sinks) with respect to the desired basis
\item Speciation
\item Reaction stepping in operator split mode
%\item Evaluation of local residual and Jacobian entries for grid cell
%\begin{itemize}
%\item Note that \emph{evaluation} does not construct the global Jacobian
%\end{itemize}
\item Delivery of secondary variables (e.g. pH, reaction rates, mineral saturation, etc.) at the request of the client
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{Constraint Processing}
\begin{itemize}
\item Domain scientist rarely want to define the IC/BC for a problem
  purely in terms of total component concentrations.
\item Often want to specify the system in variables that are
  closer to observational data. for example:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item pH instead of Total $H^+$
    \item aqueous $CO_2$ at equilibrium with the atmosphere
    \item $Ca^{2+}$ in equilibrium with calcite
    \item $Cl^-$ based on charge balance.
  \end{itemize}
\item What does this mean for state, transport and input processing?
\item Initial and boundary conditions are no longer simple lists of
  dirichlet conditions.
\item ``Geochemical Conditions'' must be preprocessed by the
  geochemistry engine to determine the appropriate dirichlet condition
  to apply.
\item ...
\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{\pft Geochemistry Flowchart}
\begin{itemize}
\item Initialization
\item Read input deck
\item Set basis (read database, form reaction network)
\item Equilibrate constraints
\item Reaction step
\item Speciate for output
\end{itemize}
